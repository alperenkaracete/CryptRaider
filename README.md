## 🕵️‍♂️ About the Game

In this game, you take on the role of a daring thief delving deep into a forgotten crypt in search of a legendary treasure.

You begin trapped in a small prison cell within a mysterious underground vault. You don’t know where to go, but something catches your eye — a glowing, floating statue. Could it be the key to your escape?

You pick up the statue and discover that placing it on a glowing podium nearby triggers something magical — a hidden wall opens, revealing a secret passage.

You venture deeper into the crypt.

As you explore the ancient, dimly lit corridors, you'll notice the beautifully immersive lighting and shadows. That’s thanks to Unreal Engine’s powerful **Lumen** lighting system, bringing the atmosphere of the crypt to life.

Eventually, you reach the inner sanctum — a grand chamber where a radiant golden idol awaits.

Now it's time to grab the treasure...

And escape — **if you can.**
